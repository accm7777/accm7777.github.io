We developed our visualization tool using the ultimate web technology in terms of interactivity and graphical quality. D3 library was chosen to render elements in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). Leaflet library was chosen to render the interactive map, as well as the GPS dependent operations. Both these libraries are manipulated in JavaScript programming language. All of these elements were embedded in an HTML5 web page.
